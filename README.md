# datatool-english
Language support for datatool.sty v3.0+

As from version 3.0, the `datatool` package will provide
localisation support (via the [`tracklang`](https://ctan.org/pkg/tracklang) package).
This `datatool-english` bundle provides support for English.

Note that the [`datatool-regions`](https://github.com/nlct/datatool-regions)
bundle provides the language-independent region ldf files. Both
`datatool-regions` and `datatool-english` need to be installed for
regional English support.

If a pre-3.0 version of `datatool` is installed, these ldf files
will be ignored.
